Sprint 1 (2/2/2020 - 2/15/2020)

Sprint 2 (2/16/2020 - 2/29/2020)
* I am a hospital worker and I want to be able to predict whether or not a given pre-hospitalized patient will be re-hospitalized given changes in their vital signs after release.


Sprint 3 (3/1/2020 - 3/14/2020)
* I am a hospital worker and I want to be able to predict whether a patient previously hospitalized for congestive heart failure will be re-hospitalized in the future given changes in their vital signs.
